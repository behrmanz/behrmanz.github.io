As an follow-up to [EECS Simulator](https://behrmanz.github.io/projects/5_project/), [Jonah Ableman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-ableman/) and I created A2-GO as a way to impart our Ann-Arbor knowledge in a fun and interactive way. 

This project utilized the [Unity](https://unity.com) game engine, the [AR Foundation Framework](https://unity.com/unity/features/arfoundation), and the [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/) in order to create a full-fledged, Pokemon-GO inspired iOS application.

Working through this project gave me a deeper understanding of the Unity ecosystem, working with external APIs, and designing for mobile interfaces.

As the player, your goal in A2-Go is to purchase and plant various trees across the city, which in turn provide you with passive income to invest in more expensive plants. Along the way, however, you must defend your precious trees from squirrels who intend on ruining your hard work!

Additionally, excess funds can be used to purchase cosmetic skins to enhance the look of your avatar:
