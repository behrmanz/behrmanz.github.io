In November 2021, the University of Michigan hosted a DJ set from [Shigeto](http://shigeto.live), a Detroit-based artist with over [100,000 monthly listeners on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/48C2RLG6w7o4jAJjCJKZM8?si=13GyxpFCSlqH5qoNbIYzJA&nd=1). I was given the opportunity to create a visual installation to accompany Shigeto's performance and created a series of works (a portion of which will be shown below).

All of the works were entirely computer-generated with the use of GLSL and [TouchDesigner](http://derivative.ca).

An overall motif within this installation was portraying increasing connection between nature and technology via the use of "life-like" movements (heavily drawing upon fractals and their derivations).

Overall, the show had a record attendance of over 350 people throughout the night and garnered attention from people across the Metro-Detroit area. Special thanks to the Michigan community for highlighting my work.

Here's a few pieces that were included in show:
