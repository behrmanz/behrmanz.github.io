As I wrap up my final semester, it seems only fitting to capture the energy of what it means to be an EECS student. With my friend [Jonah Ableman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-ableman/), we set out to make a VR experience that pays homage to our communities (many) quirks.

EECS simulator is set inside the [Bob and Betty Beyster Building](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/about/beyster-building/) on the University of Michigan's north campus. Within this eclectic computer lab, we've strived to give you (an EECS student) all the functionality required to make it through a typical day. Below are a few examples:

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/eecs_simulator/copier.gif" title="Item Copier" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A working "photo-copier" that duplicates items on use. Do you see the Pokemon inspiration?
</div>

    <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/eecs_simulator/whiteboard.gif" title="Whiteboard" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A working whiteboard (would work great in a coding interview).
</div>

On the spare chance you have off-time within the simulator, we've included a fun Pokemon catching minigame (a favorite pastime of EECS students)! Below is footage of capturing a magnemite (the perfect companion for any engineer).

There are many more interactions within EECS simulator that have not been touched on here. Please see the video below for a more detailed walkthrough of everything EECS simulator has to offer!
