An important part of my club, Maize Collective, is teaching new modes of expression to the larger University of Michigan community. Our campus has a diverse set of student interests, but I personally believe art can be found in whatever someone decides to pursue.

As such, during the 2021-2022 school year, I embarked on a set of classes to introduce the concept of generative art through [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/). Each session was designed with a concrete final product that attendees could not only replicate, but make their own.

The project (in tandem with my original work) received $1000 from [ArtsEngine](https://artsengine.engin.umich.edu/), an organization that strives to improve cross-disciplinary works on campus. 

Furthermore, our ultimate workshop was co-sponsored by the [PAT](https://smtd.umich.edu/departments/performing-arts-technology/) department, with faculty member [Kiera Saltz](https://kierasaltz.com/) presenting on advanced modality opportunities within TouchDesigner.

A post-mortem of the project as well as footage from the final session can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/742451941?embedded=true&source=vimeo_logo&owner=69286035).
