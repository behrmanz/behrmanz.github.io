Hi, and welcome to my page!

I'm a rising senior at the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu) pursuing a dual-degree in Computer Science and Business. On campus, I'm the president of [Maize Collective](https://www.instagram.com/maizecollective/?hl=en) which aims to explore and teach inter-disciplinary artforms. I also play/write music and perform on campus.

Outside of school, I'm a two-time [Google intern](https://careers.google.com/students/), with work experience in applied research and internal tool creation.

Please feel free to reach out to me at behrmanz@umich.edu.
